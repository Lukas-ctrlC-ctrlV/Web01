# Pizza Company - One-Page Website Presentation

This project is a one-page website presentation for a fictional "Pizza Company". The site aims to provide information about the offerings, introduce the company, display customer testimonials, and provide a contact form. It is designed with responsiveness in mind for various screen sizes.

## Features

* **Clear Sections:** The page is divided into logical sections: Introduction, Our Pizza, About Our Pizza, References, Photogallery, and Contact.
* **Intuitive Navigation:** The top navigation menu allows easy scrolling between different sections with smooth scrolling animation.
* **Pizza Presentation:** The "Our Pizza" and "About Our Pizza" sections visually present the offered products and provide basic information.
* **Customer Testimonials:** The "References" section includes quotes from satisfied customers with their names and photos (avatars).
* **Photogallery:** A gallery of pizza images for a visual presentation of the menu.
* **Contact Form:** A simple form for sending messages or inquiries.
* **Responsive Design:** The layout and appearance of the page adapt to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) thanks to the implemented grid system and media queries.
* **Mobile Navigation:** For smaller screens, a hamburger menu is implemented, which toggles the visibility of navigation links and changes its icon upon clicking.
* **Smooth Scrolling:** Clicking on navigation links results in a smooth, animated scroll to the corresponding section.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML:** For the structure and content of the web page (`index.html`).
* **CSS:** For visual styling, layout (using a custom grid system), and responsive design (`devaty-web.css`, `grids/grid.css`, `queries.css`).
* **JavaScript (jQuery):** For mobile navigation interactivity and smooth scrolling (`jQuery/script.js` and the jQuery library from CDN).
